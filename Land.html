        <p>Bagalkot is a city located in the northern part of Karnataka, India. It is known for its rich history,
            cultural heritage, and vibrant community.
            Kannada is the primary language spoken in Bagalkot.Bagalkot district, officially Bagalakote is an
            administrative district in the Indian state of Karnataka. The district headquarters is located in the town
            of Bagalakote. The district is located in northern Karnataka and borders Belgaum, Gadag, Koppal, Raichur and
            Bijapur.
            The new Bagalakote district was carved out of Vijayapura in 1997 via Government of Karnataka
            directive Notification RD 42 LRD 87 Part III. The bifurcated Bagalkot district consists of ten taluks

        <h2 class="h">HISTORY</h2>
        <p>Over 191 Middle Palaeolithic localities have been discovered in the Kaladgi basin of the district. The
            discovery of settlements in the village of Lakhamapura near the Malaprabha valley yielded the identification
            of quartzitic artefacts such as handaxes and cleavers. A pre-Chalukyan brick temple was discovered at the
            foothills of Bachinagudda, in Pattadakal, where an idol depicting the bust of Chaturmukha Shiva was
            discovered. Evidence of megalithic habitation was also discovered at the foothills of Bachinagudda, as were
            Marahathi and Satavahana coins of a later period.</p>

        <p>The first documented evidence of the existence of Bagalkot district dates back to the 2nd century CE, when
            the taluks of Badami, Indi and Kalkeri were mentioned in the works of the Greek astronomer Ptolemy. In the
            6th century CE, the Hindu Chalukya rulers ruled over much of present South India. The Chalukyan king
            Pulakeshin I established Bagalkot as his administrative headquarters; the district retained its prominent
            status until the Chalukyan empire was sacked by the Rashtrakutas in 753 CE. The Chinese explorer Hieun-Tsang
            visited Badami and described the people as "tall, proud,...brave and exceedingly chivalrous". He
            estimated the kingdom to be approximately 1,200 mi in circumference.

            The period of rule of the Chalukyas of Badami, whose kingdom stretched from modern Karnataka to Maharashtra
            and Gujarat, was a highlight of Bagalkot's history. Chalukya king Pulakeshin II further consolidated the
            empire by battling with the Kadambas, Gangas, Mauryas of the Konkan, Gurjaras and Emperor Harshavardhana,
            whom he vanquished on the banks of the Narmada river Accounts of war were inscribed on stone structures
            in the town of Aihole, now located in the taluk of Hungund. The Kalyani Chalukyas, descendants of the Badami
            Chalukyas, conquered the area before the dawn of the 10th century CE. Their rule was interspersed with wars
            against the Cholas and Hoysalas. The Kalyani Chalukyas moved their capital from Badami to Kalyani, in the
            present day district of Bidar. Akkadevi, sister of the Kalyani Chalukya Jayasimha II ruled in the area for
            more than 40 years from 1024 CE. During the course of her rule of the area, then known as Kisukadu, seventy
            villages from Bagalkot district were added to her administration. The Chola king Vīrarajendra seized the
            area by defeating Someshvara I at Koodalasangama. By the 11th century CE, all of Karnataka including
            Bagalkot fell into the dominion of the Hoysala Empire, first consolidated by Veera Ballala and later
            subordinated to the Sinda kings.</p>
